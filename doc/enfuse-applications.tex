\chapter[Applications of \App]{Applications of \App
  \label{sec:applications}
  \genidx[\rangebeginlocation]{applications of \App}}

This section describes some of the novel possibilities that \App{}
offers the photographer.  In contrast to the previous chapters, it
centers around the effects on the final image.

\section[What Makes Images Fusable?]{What Makes Images Fusable?
  \label{sec:what-makes-images-fusable}
  \genidx{images!fusable}}

\begin{sloppypar}
  Images should align well to be suitable for fusion.  However, there
  is no hard mathematical rule what ``well'' means.  The alignment
  requirements for 16~MPixel images to yield a sharp $4" \times 6"$
  print at 300\dmn{dpi} or even for web presentation are relatively
  low, whereas the alignment of 8~MPixel images for a $12" \times 18"$
  print ought to be tight.
\end{sloppypar}

If the input images need to be aligned,
\application{Hugin}\appidx{Hugin} (see also
Appendix~\fullref{app:hugin}) is the tool of choice.  It produces
images exactly in the format that \App{} expects.

Sometimes images naturally align extremely well so that no
re-alignment is required.  An image series with preprogrammed exposure
steps taken in rapid succession where the camera is mounted on a heavy
tripod and a humongous ball head, mirror lockup, and a cable release
are used, comes to mind.

When in doubt about what will work, try it, and judge for yourself.

\noindent Useful ideas for a good alignment:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Fix all camera parameters that are not explicitly varied.

  \begin{description}
  \item[Aperture:] Engage full manual or aperture-priority mode.

  \item[Auto-focus:] Disable ``Auto Focus''.  Be aware that the
    auto-focus function could be linked to shutter-release button
    position ``half pressed'' or to the shutter release in insidious
    ways.

  \item[Closed eyepiece:] Close the eyepiece when using a cable
    release to suppress variations in stray light.  (This tip applies
    only to single lens reflex cameras.)

  \item[Exposure time/Shutter speed:] Use the shortest possible
    exposure time or, in other words, use the fastest shutter speed to
    avoid blur caused by camera shake or motion blur.

  \item[Flash power:] Explicitly control the flash power of \emph{all}
    flashes.  This is sometimes called ``flash exposure lock''.

  \item[Sensitivity:] Disable ``Auto \acronym{ISO}''.

  \item[White balance:] Disable ``Auto White Balance''.  Instead, use
    the most suitable fixed white balance or take the white balance
    off a white card.  When in doubt, use the setting ``Daylight'' or
    equivalent.
  \end{description}

\item
  Steady the camera by any means.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Apply your best camera bracing technique combined with controlled
    breathing.
  \item
    Prefer a monopod, or better, a rigid tripod with a heavy head.
  \item
    Use a cable release if possible.
  \item
    (This applies to cameras with a moving mirror only.)  Engage
    ``mirror lockup''.
  \item
    Consider automatic bracketing when applicable.
  \item
    Activate camera- or lens-based image stabilization if you are sure
    that it improves the image quality in your particular case;
    otherwise disengage the feature.

    For some lens-based image stabilization systems, it is known that
    they ``lock'' into different positions every time they are
    activated.  Moreover, some stabilization systems decrease the
    image quality if the lens is mounted on a tripod.
  \end{itemize}

\item
  Fire in rapid succession.
\end{itemize}

\section[Repetition -- Noise Reduction]%
{Repetition -- Noise Reduction
  \label{sec:repetition}
  \genidx{simple series}
  \genidx{series!simple}
  \genidx{noise reduction}}

\mainpurpose{Reduce noise}

With the default settings, \App{} computes a weighted average of the
input pixels.  For a series of images, repeated with identical
settings, this results in a reduction of (photon shot) noise.  In
other words, the dynamic range increases slightly, because the higher
signal-to-noise ratio makes darker shades usable.  Furthermore, smooth
or glossy surfaces get a ``cleaner'' look, and edges become visually
sharper.  The nitty-gritty reportage look that sometimes stems from a
high sensitivity setting disappears.

Averaged images, and therefore low-noise images, are the base for a
multitude of techniques like, for example, differences.  The most
prominent method in this class is dark-frame subtraction.

\App{} sets defaults for the exposure-weight to
\val{val:default-weight-exposure}, for saturation-weight to
\val{val:default-weight-saturation} and for all other weights to zero,
a good combination for noise reduction.  Eliminating the saturation
component with \option{--saturation-weight=0.0} sometimes can be worth
the extra run.


\section[Exposure Series -- Dynamic Range Increase]%
{Exposure Series -- Dynamic Range Increase
  \label{sec:exposure-series--dynamic-range-increase}
  \genidx{exposure series}
  \genidx{series!exposure}
  \genidx{dynamic range increase}}

\mainpurpose{Increase manageable dynamic range}

An exposure series is a set of images taken with identical parameters
except for the exposure time.  Some cameras even provide special
functions to automate recording exposure series.  See the instruction
manual of your model for details.  Also check out the features that
Magic Lantern offers to shoot \acronym{HDR}-series and to extend the
dynamic range right in the camera.

\App{}'s defaults,
\code{exposure-weight}=\val{val:default-weight-exposure} and
\code{saturation-weight}=\val{val:default-weight-saturation} are well
suited for fusion of \emph{color} images.  Remember that saturation
weighting only works for \acronym{RGB} data.
Option~\option{--saturation-weight} helps to control burnt-out
highlights, as these are heavily desaturated.  Alternatively, use
option~\option{--exposure-cutoff} to suppress noise or blown-out
highlights without altering the overall brightness too much.  If no
image suffers from troublesome highlights, the relative saturation
weight can be reduced and even be set to zero.

For black and white images \sample{--entropy-weight} can be an
alternative to \sample{--saturation-weight} because it suppresses
overexposed pixels, as these contain little information.  However,
entropy weighting is not limited to gray-scale data; it has been
successfully applied to \acronym{RGB} images, too.  Note that entropy
weighting considers \emph{each} color channel of an \acronym{RGB}
image separately and chooses the channel with the minimum entropy as
representative for the whole pixel.

\App{} offers the photographer tremendous flexibility in fusing
differently exposed images.  Whether you combine only two pictures or
a series of 21, \App{} imposes no limits on you.  Accordingly, the
photographic effects achieved range from subtle to surreal, like the
late 1980s ``Max Headroom'' \acronym{TV}-Series, to really unreal.
Like some time ago in the chemical days of photography, when a new
developer opened unseen possibilities for artists, exposure fusion
extends a photographer's expressive space in the digital age.  Whether
the results look good or bad, whether the images are dull or exciting,
is entirely up the artist.

In the next sections we give assistance to starters, and rectify
several misconceptions about \App{}.


\subsection[Tips For Beginners]{Tips For Beginners
  \label{sec:tips-for-beginners}
  \genidx{exposure series!tips for beginners}}

Here are some tips to get you in business quickly.

\begin{description}
\item[Include the best single exposure.]\itemend Include the exposure
  you would have taken if you did not use \App{} in your series.  It
  gives you a solid starting point.  Think of the other images as
  augmenting this best single exposure to bring out the light and dark
  features you would like to see.

\item[Begin with as small a number of images as possible.]\itemend
  Pre-visualizing the results of \App{} is difficult.  The more images
  put into the fusion process and the wider their \acronym{EV}-spacing
  is, the more challenging visualizing the output image becomes.
  Therefore, start off with as few images as possible.

  You can take a larger series of images and only use part of it.

\item[Start with a moderate \acronym{EV}-spacing.]\itemend As has been
  pointed out in the previous item, a wide \acronym{EV}-spacing makes
  pre-visualization harder.  So start out with a spacing of
  $\slfrac{2}{3}$\dmn{EV} to $\slfrac{4}{3}$\dmn{EV}.

\item[Use Magic Lantern's dual-\acronym{ISO} mode (and avoid
  \App).]\itemend Magic Lantern can reprogram a camara to take a
  \emph{single} short with \emph{two different} sensor speeds.  They
  call it ``dual-\acronym{ISO}'' mode.  The non-standard RAW~image
  created that way must be processed with
  \command{cr2hdr}\footnote{\command{cr2hdr} is part of Magic
    Lantern's source distribution.}, which produces a
  \acronym{DNG}~file readable with the usual RAW~converters.
\end{description}


\subsection[Common Misconceptions]{Common Misconceptions
  \label{sec:common-misconceptions}
  \genidx{exposure series!common misconceptions}}

Here are some surprisingly common misconceptions about exposure
series.

\begin{description}
\item[A single image cannot be the source of an exposure
  series.]\itemend Raw-files in particular lend themselves to be
  converted multiple times and the results being fused together.  The
  technique is simpler, faster, and usually even looks better than
  \uref{\luminouslandscapedigitalblending}{digital
    blending}\genidx{digital blending} (as opposed to using a
  graduated neutral density filter) or
  \uref{\gimpguruorgblendingexposures}{blending
    exposures}\genidx{blending exposures} in an image manipulation
  program.  Moreover, perfect alignment comes free of charge!

\item[An exposure series must feature symmetrically-spaced
  exposures.]\itemend Twice wrong!  Neither do the exposures have to
  be ``symmetric'' like \{0\dmn{EV}, $-\slfrac{2}{3}$\dmn{EV},
  $+\slfrac{2}{3}$\dmn{EV}\}, nor does the number of exposures have to
  be odd.  Series like \{$-\slfrac{4}{3}$\dmn{EV},
  $-\slfrac{1}{3}$\dmn{EV}, $+\slfrac{1}{3}$\dmn{EV}\} or
  \{$-1$\dmn{EV}, 1\dmn{EV}\} might be just right.  By the way, the
  order in which the images were taken does not matter either.

\item[An exposure series must cover the whole dynamic range of the
  scene.]\itemend If you do not want to cover the whole range, you do
  not have to.  Some \acronym{HDR} programs require the user to take a
  light probe,\footnote{\uref{\debevecorg}{Paul E.~Debevec} defines:
    ``A light probe\genidx{light probe} image is an omnidirectional,
    high dynamic range image that records the incident illumination
    conditions at a particular point in space.''} whereas \App{}
  offers the user complete freedom of exposure.

\item[All exposure values must be different.]\itemend You can repeat
  any exposure as often as you like.  That way you combine an exposure
  series with parts of Section~\ref{sec:repetition}, emphasizing the
  multiply occuring exposures and reducing noise.
\end{description}

\section[Polarization Series -- Saturation Enhancement]{Polarization Series -- Saturation Enhancement
  \label{sec:polarization-series--saturation-enhancement}
  \genidx{polarization series}
  \genidx{series!polarization}
  \genidx{saturation enhancement}}

\mainpurpose{Reflection suppression, saturation enhancement}

In the current implementation of \App{}, it is not possible in general
to fuse a polarization series.  Naively (ab)using
\sample{--saturation-weight} will not work.


\section[Focus Stacks -- Depth-of-Field Increase]{Focus Stacks -- Depth-of-Field Increase
  \label{sec:focus-stacks--depth-of-field-increase}
  \genidx{focus stacks}
  \genidx{depth-of-focus increase}}

\mainpurpose{Synthetic Depth-of-Field Increase}

A focus stack is a series of images where the distance of the focal
plane from the sensor varies.  Sloppily speaking, the images were
focussed at different distances.  Fusing such a stack increases the
depth-of-field\genidx{depth-of-field}
(\acronym{DoF}\genidx{DoF@\acronym{DoF}}) beyond the physical limits of
diffraction.


\subsection[Why create focus stacks?]{Why create focus stacks?
  \label{sec:why-create-focus-stacks}
  \genidx{focus stacks!why to create them?}}

Given
\begin{itemize}
\item
  a fixed sensor or film size,
\item
  a lens' particular focal length, and
\item
  a notion about ``sharpness'', technically speaking the size of the
  circle-of-confusion\genidx{circle-of-confusion}
  (\acronym{CoC}\genidx{CoC@\acronym{CoC}})
\end{itemize}

\noindent the photographer controls the
depth-of-field\genidx{depth-of-field} with the aperture.  Smaller
apertures -- this is larger aperture numbers -- increase the
\acronym{DoF} and vice versa.  However, smaller apertures increase
diffraction which in turn renders the image unsharp.  So, there is an
optimum aperture where the photographer gets maximum \acronym{DoF}.
Sadly, for some purposes like macro shots it is not enough.  One way
out is to combine the sharp parts of images focused at different
distances, thereby artificially increasing the total \acronym{DoF}.
This is exactly what \App{} can do.

All lenses have a so called ``sweet spot''\genidx{sweet spot aperture}
aperture,\genidx{aperture!sweet spot} where their resolution is best.
Taking pictures at this aperture, the photographer squeezes the
maximum quality out of the lens.  But: the ``sweet spot'' aperture
often is only one or two stops away from wide open.  Wouldn't it be
great to be able combine these best-possible images to form one
high-quality, sufficient-\acronym{DoF} image?  Welcome to \App{}'s
local-contrast selection abilities.


\subsection[Preparing Focus Stacks]{Preparing Focus Stacks
  \label{sec:preparing-focus-stacks}
  \genidx{focus stacks!preparation}}

We are going to combine images with limited \acronym{DoF} to increase
their in-focus parts.  The whole process is about image sharpness.
Therefore, the input images must align very well, not just well, but
very well.  For optimum results the maximum control point distance in
\application{Hugin} should not exceed 0.3--0.5~pixels to ensure
perfect blending.

As in all image fusion operations it is preferable to use 16~bit
linear (i.e. gamma = 1) images throughout, but 8~bit gamma-encoded
images will do.  Naturally, high
signal-to-noise\genidx{signal-to-noise ratio}
(\acronym{SNR}\gensee{SNR@\acronym{SNR}}{signal-to-noise ratio}) ratio
input data always is welcome.


\subsection[Local Contrast Based Fusing]{Local Contrast Based Fusing
  \label{sec:local-contrast-based-fusing}
  \genidx{local-contrast-based fusing}
  \genidx{fusing!local-contrast-based}
  \genidx{focus stacks!fusing}}

A bare bones call to \App{} for focus stacking could look like this.
\begin{terminal}
  \$ enfuse \bslash \\
  ~~~~--exposure-weight=0 \bslash \\
  ~~~~--saturation-weight=0 \bslash \\
  ~~~~--contrast-weight=1 \bslash \\
  ~~~~--hard-mask \bslash \\
  ~~~~\dots{} \bslash \\
  ~~~~--output=output.tif \bslash \\
  ~~~~input-<0000-9999>.tif
\end{terminal}

Here is what each option causes:

\begin{codelist}
\item[--exposure-weight=0]\itemend Switch \strong{off} exposure based
  pixel selection.  The default weight is
  \val{val:default-weight-exposure}.

\item[--saturation-weight=0]\itemend Switch \strong{off} saturation
  based pixel selection.  The default weight is
  \val{val:default-weight-saturation}.

\item[--contrast-weight=1]\itemend Switch \strong{on} pixel selection
  based on local contrast.

\item[--hard-mask]\itemend Select the best pixel from the image stack
  and ignore all others.  Without this option, \App{} uses all pixels
  in the stack and weights them according to their respective quality,
  which in our case is local contrast.  Without \sample{--hard-mask},
  the result will always look a bit soft.  See also
  Section~\fullref{sec:local-contrast-weighting}.
\end{codelist}

If you want to see some entertaining progress messages --
local-contrast weighting takes a while --, also pass the
\option{--verbose}~option for an entertaining progress report.


\subsection[Basic Focus Stacking]{Basic Focus Stacking
  \label{sec:basic-focus-stacking}
  \genidx{basic focus stacking}
  \genidx{focus stacking!basic}}

For a large class of image stacks \App{}'s default algorithm, as
selected in \ref{sec:local-contrast-based-fusing}, to determine the
sharpness produces nice results.  The algorithm uses a moving square
window, the so-called contrast window.  It computes the standard
deviation of the pixels inside of the window.  The program then
selects the window's center pixel of the image in the stack where the
standard deviation is largest, that is, the local contrast reaches the
maximum.

However, the algorithm fails to deliver good masks for images which
exhibit high contrast edges on the scale of the contrast window size.
The typical artifacts that show up are
\begin{itemize}
\item
  faint dark seams on the light side of the high contrast edges and
\item
  extremely soft, slightly lighter seams on the dark side of the high
  contrast edges,
\end{itemize}
\noindent where the distance of the seams from the middle of the edge
is comparable to the contrast window size.

If your results do not show any of these artifacts, stick with the
basic algorithm.  Advanced focus stacking, as described in the next
sections, delivers superior results in case of artifacts, though
requires manually tuning several parameters.


\subsection[Advanced Focus Stacking]{Advanced Focus Stacking
  \label{sec:advanced-focus-stacking}
  \genidx{advanced focus stacking}
  \genidx{focus stacking!advanced}}

If your fused image shows any of the defects described in the previous
section, you can try a more difficult-to-use algorithm that
effectively works around the seam artifacts.  It is described in the
next section.


\subsubsection[Detailed Look at the Problem]{Detailed Look at the Problem
  \label{sec:detailed-look-at-the-problem}
  \genidx{local contrast problem}
  \genidx{problem!local contrast}}

Let us use an example to illustrate the problem of relating the
sharpness with the local contrast variations.  Say we use a $5 \times
5$ contrast window.  Moreover, let \code{sharp\_edge} and
\code{smooth\_edge} be two specific configurations:

\begin{literal}
  sharp\_edge~=~~[~~~~0,  ~~0,  200,  ~~0,  ~~0; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0,  225,  ~~0,  ~~0,  ~~0; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0,  255,  ~~0,  ~~0,  ~~0; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~215,  ~~0,  ~~0,  ~~0,  ~~0; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~200,  ~~0,  ~~0,  ~~0,  ~~0]
\end{literal}

\begin{literal}
  smooth\_edge~=~[~~~~0,  ~62,  125,  187,  250; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1,  ~63,  126,  188,  251; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2,  ~65,  127,  190,  252; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3,  ~66,  128,  191,  253; \\
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5,  ~67,  130,  192,  255]
\end{literal}

\noindent where \sample{;} separates the rows and \sample{,} separates
the columns.  This is in fact \uref{\gnuorgoctave}{Octave} syntax.
Figures~\ref{fig:sharp-edge} and~\ref{fig:smooth-edge} show plots of
the matrices \code{sharp\_edge} and~\code{smooth\_edge}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{maxipage}
    \centering
    \includeimage{sharp-edge}
  \end{maxipage}

  \caption[Sharp edge]{3D plot augmented by contour plot of the
    matrix~\code{sharp\_edge}.\label{fig:sharp-edge}}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{maxipage}
    \centering
    \includeimage{smooth-edge}
  \end{maxipage}

  \caption[Smooth edge]{3D plot augmented by contour plot of the
    matrix~\code{smooth\_edge}.\label{fig:smooth-edge}}
\end{figure}


Our intuition lets us ``see'' an extremely sharp edge in the first
matrix, whereas the second one describes an extraordinarily smooth
diagonal intensity ramp.  Which one will be selected?  Well,
\code{sharp\_edge} has a standard deviation of 88.07 and
\code{smooth\_edge} has 88.41.  Thus, \code{smooth\_edge} wins,
contradicting our intuition, and even worse, our intention!  Sadly,
configurations like \code{smooth\_edge} occur more often with
high-quality, good \uref{\luminouslandscapebokeh}{bokeh} lenses.  In
fact, they are the very manifestation of ``good bokeh''.  Therefore,
Laplacian edge detection plays an important role when working with
high-quality lenses.


\subsubsection[\propername{Laplacian} Edge Detection]{\propername{Laplacian} Edge Detection
  \label{sec:laplacian-edge-detection}
  \genidx{edge detection!Laplacian@\propername{Laplacian}}
  \gensee{Laplacian edge detection@\propername{Laplacian} edge detection}%
         {edge detection, \propername{Laplacian}}}

\App{} provides a Laplacian-based algorithm that can help in
situations where weighting based on the standard deviation fails.  It
is activated with a positive value for \metavar{SCALE} in
\option{--contrast-edge-scale}=\metavar{SCALE}.  The Laplacian will
detect two-dimensional \emph{curvature} on the scale of
\metavar{SCALE}.  Here and in the following we simply speak of
``curvature'' where we mean ``magnitude of curvature''.  That is, we
shall not distinguish between convex and concave edges.  \App{} always
use the magnitude of curvature for weighting.

Typically, \metavar{SCALE} ranges between 0.1~pixels and 0.5~pixels,
where 0.3~pixels are a reasonable starting point.  To find the best
value for \metavar{SCALE} though, usually some experimentation will be
necessary.  Use \sample{--save-masks} to get all soft-mask (default:
\mbox{\code{\val{val:default-soft-mask-template}}}) and hard-mask
files (\mbox{\code{\val{val:default-hard-mask-template}}}).  Check how
different scales affect the artifacts.  Also see
Chapter~\fullref{sec:understanding-masks}.


\subsubsection[Local Contrast Enhancement]{Local Contrast Enhancement
  \label{sec:local-contrast-enhancement}
  \genidx{local contrast enhancement}
  \genidx{contrast enhancement!local}}

Sometimes \App{} misses smoother edges with
\sample{--contrast-edge-scale} and a little local contrast enhancement
(\acronym{LCE}) helps.  Set
\option{--contrast-edge-scale}=\feasiblebreak
\metavar{SCALE}:\feasiblebreak \metavar{LCE-SCALE}:\feasiblebreak
\metavar{LCE-FACTOR}, where \metavar{LCE-SCALE} and
\metavar{LCE-FACTOR} work like the
\uref{\cambridgeincolourcomunsharpmask}{unsharp mask} filters in
various image manipulation programs.  Start with \metavar{LCE-SCALE}
ten times the value of \metavar{SCALE} and a \metavar{LCE-FACTOR} of
2--5.

\metavar{LCE-SCALE} can be specified as a percentage of
\metavar{SCALE}.  \metavar{LCE-FACTOR} also can be specified as a
percentage.  Examples:

\begin{literal}
--contrast-edge-scale=0.3:3.0:3 \\
--contrast-edge-scale=0.3:1000\%:3.0 \\
--contrast-edge-scale=0.3:3:300\% \\
--contrast-edge-scale=0.3:1000\%:300\%
\end{literal}

By default \acronym{LCE} is turned off.


\subsubsection[Suppressing Noise or Recognizing Faint Edges]{Suppressing Noise or Recognizing Faint Edges
  \label{sec:suppressing-noise-or-recognizing-faint-edges}
  \genidx{advanced focus stacking!suppressing noise}
  \genidx{advanced focus stacking!recognizing faint edges}}

The \propername{Laplacian}-based algorithm is much better at resisting
the seam problem than the local-contrast algorithm, but it has two
shortcomings:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The \propername{Laplacian} is very susceptible to noise and
\item
  it fails to recognize faint edges.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent The option~\option{--contrast-min-curvature} option helps to
mitigate both flaws.

The argument to \option{--contrast-min-curvature}=\metavar{CURVATURE}
either is an absolute lightness value, e.g.\ 0\dots255 for 8~bit data
and 0\dots65535 for 16~bit data, or, when given with a
\sample{\%}-sign it is a relative lightness value ranging from 0\%
to~100\%.

To suppress unreal edges or counter excessive noise, use the
\option{--contrast-min-curvature}~option with a \emph{negative}
curvature measure~\metavar{CURVATURE}.  This forces all curvatures
less than $-\metavar{CURVATURE}$ to zero.

A \emph{positive} curvature measure~\metavar{CURVATURE} makes \App{}
merge the \acronym{LoG} data with the local-contrast data.  Every
curvature larger than or equal to \metavar{CURVATURE} is left
unchanged, and every curvature less than \metavar{CURVATURE} gets
replaced with the rescaled local-contrast data, such that the largest
local contrast is just below \metavar{CURVATURE}.  This combines the
best parts of both techniques and ensures a precise edge detection
over the whole range of edge curvatures.

\noindent\strong{Summary}

\begin{codelist}
\item[\option{--contrast-edge-scale=0.3}]\itemend Use \acronym{LoG} to
  detect edges on a scale of 0.3~pixels.  Apply the default grayscale
  projector: \code{average}.

  and 0.5\% with \acronym{SDev} data.  Use a window of $7 \times
  7$~pixel window to compute the \acronym{SDev}.

contrast window.  Only if seams appear as described in
Section~\ref{sec:advanced-focus-stacking} switch to
\propername{Laplacian}-of-\propername{Gaussian} contrast detection.

If some seams remain even in \acronym{LoG}-mode, decrease the
sensitivity of the edge detection with a positive
\sample{--contrast-min-curvature}.  A too high value of
\sample{--contrast-min-curvature} suppresses fine detail though.  Part
of the detail can be brought back with pre-sharpening, that is,
\ref{sec:local-contrast-enhancement} or combining \acronym{LoG} with
local-contrast-window mode by using a negative
\sample{--contrast-min-curvature}.

Carefully examining the masks (option~\option{--save-masks}) that
\App{} uses helps to judge the effects of the parameters.

We have collected some advice with which even focus-stacking adepts
can benefit.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ensure that the sensor is clean.\genidx{sensor!use clean}

  Aligning focus stacks requires varying the viewing angle, which
  corresponds to a changing focal length.  Hence, the same pixel on
  the sensor gets mapped onto different positions in the final image.
  Dirt spots will occur not only once but as many times as there are
  images in the stack -- something that is no fun to correct in
  postprocessing.

  Along the same lines, the photographer may want to consider to
  prepare dark frames\genidx{dark frame}\genidx{subtraction of dark
    frame} before, and possibly also after, the shoot of the focus
  stack, to subtract hot pixels\genidx{hot pixels}\genidx{pixels!hot}
  before fusion.

\item
  Prefer a low-sensitivity setting (``\acronym{ISO}'') on the camera
  to get low-noise images.

  Fusing with option~\option{--hard-mask}\optidx{--hard-mask} does
  not average, and thus does not suppress any noise in the input
  images.

\item
  If the transition of in-focus to out-of-focus areas is too abrupt,
  record the images with closest and farthest focusing distances
  twice: first with the intended working aperture, and a second time
  with a small aperture (large aperture number).

  The small aperture will give the fused image a more natural in-focus
  to out-of-focus transition\genidx{natural sharp-unsharp
    transition}\genidx{transition!natural sharp-unsharp} and the
  working-aperture shots supply the detail in the in-focus regions.

\item
  Consider the use of Magic Lantern
  (Appendix~\fullref{app:magiclantern}) to automate the creation of
  focus stacks.
