The default configuration of Enblend and Enfuse assumes a system with
3--4@dmn{GB} of @acronym{RAM}.

If Enblend and Enfuse have been compiled with the ``image-cache''
feature they do not rely on the operating system's memory management,
but use their own image cache.  To find out whether your version uses
the image cache say

@example
enblend --verbose --version
@end example

@noindent
or

@example
enfuse --verbose --version
@end example

@noindent
The size of the image cache is user configurable with the
option@tie{}@samp{-m @var{CACHE-SIZE}} (@pxref{Extended Options}).
Furthermore, option@tie{}@samp{-b @var{BUFFER-SIZE}} (@pxref{Extended
Options}) allows for fine-tuning the size of a single buffer inside
the image cache.  Note that @var{CACHE-SIZE} is given in megabytes,
whereas the unit of @var{BUFFER-SIZE} is kilobytes.

Usually the user lets the operating system take care of the memory
management of all processes.  However, users of Enblend or Enfuse
might want to control the balance between the operating systems'
Virtual Memory System and the image cache for several reasons.

@itemize
@item
Paging in or out parts of a process' image runs at kernel level and
thus can make user processes appear unresponsive or ``jumpy''.  The
caching mechanism of Enblend and Enfuse of course runs as a user
process, which is why it has less detrimental effects on the system's
overall responsiveness.

@item
The image cache has been optimized for accesses to image data.  And
all algorithms in Enblend and Enfuse have been carefully arranged to
play nice with the image cache.  An operating system's cache has no
knowledge of these particular memory access patterns.

@item
The disk access of the operating system to the swap device has been
highly optimized.  Enblend and Enfuse on the other hand use the
standard @acronym{IO}-layer which is a slower interface.

@item
Limiting the amount of image cache prevents Enblend and Enfuse from
eating up most or all @acronym{RAM}, thereby forcing all user
applications into the swap.

@noindent
The @var{CACHE-SIZE} should be set in a way as to reconcile all of the
above aspects even for the biggest data sets, this is, projects with
many large images.

@ref{Table:cache-size-settings} suggests some cache- and buffer-sizes
for different amounts of available @acronym{RAM}.

On systems with considerably more than 4@dmn{GB} of @acronym{RAM} it
is recommended to run Enblend or Enfuse versions without image cache.
