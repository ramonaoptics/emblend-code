  Saturation Weighting}

Saturation weighting prefers pixels with a high saturation.

\App{} computes the saturation of a pixel according to the following algorithm.

\begin{adalisting}
max := maximum(R, G, B);
min := minimum(R, G, B);
if max = min then
    saturation := 0;
else
    sum := max + min;
    difference := max - min;
    if sum <= 1 then
        saturation := difference / sum;
    else
        saturation := difference / (2 - sum);
    end if;
end if;
\end{adalisting}

The saturation weighting algorithm only looks at a single pixel at a time; the pixel's
neighborhood is not taken into account.

\genidx{weighting!entropy}Obviously, saturation weighting can only be defined for
\acronym{RGB}-images, not for grayscale ones.  If you need something similar, check out
\sectionName~\ref{sec:local-entropy-weighting} on Entropy Weighting works for both \acronym{RGB}
and grayscale pictures.
