of the standard workflow.

\item[Take Images]\itemend Take \emph{multiple} images to form a
  panorama, an exposure series, a focus stack, etc..

  There is one exception with \application{Enfuse} when a single raw
  image is converted multiple times to get several -- typically
  differently ``exposed'' -- images.

  \noindent\emph{Exemplary Benefits:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Many pictures taken from the same vantage point but showing
    different viewing directions.  -- Panorama

  \item
    Pictures of the same subject exposed with different shutter
    speeds.  -- Exposure series

  \item
    Images of the same subject focussed at differing distances.  --
    Focus stack
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent\emph{Remaining Problem:} The ``overlayed'' images may not
  fit together, that is the overlay regions may not match exactly.

\item[Convert Images]\itemend Convert the
  \uref{\luminouslandscaperawfiles}{raw data}\genidx{raw conversion}
  \genidx{conversion!raw} exploiting the full dynamic range of the
  camera and capitalize on a high-quality conversion.

\item[Align Images]\itemend Align the images so as to make them match
  as well as possible.

  Again there is one exception and this is when images naturally
  align.  For example, a series of images taken from a rock solid
  tripod with a cable release without touching the camera, or images
  taken with a shift lens, can align without further user
  intervention.

  This step submits the images to affine
  transformations.\genidx{affine transformation}
  \genidx{transformation!affine}

  If necessary, it rectifies the lens' distortions\genidx{lens
    distortion!correction of} (e.g.\ barrel or pincushion), too.

  Sometimes even luminance or color differences between pairs of
  overlaying images are corrected (``photometric
  alignment'').\genidx{photometric alignment}

  \noindent\emph{Benefit:} The overlay areas of images match as
  closely as possible given the quality if the input images and the
  lens model used in the transformation.

  \noindent\emph{Remaining Problem:} The images may still not align
  perfectly, for example, because of
  \uref{\wikipediaparallax}{parallax} errors,\genidx{parallax error}
  or blur produced by camera shake.

\item[Combine Images]\itemend \application{Enblend} and
  \application{Enfuse} Enfuse combine the aligned images into one.

  \noindent\emph{Benefit:} The overlay areas become imperceptible for
  all but the most mal-aligned images.

  \noindent\emph{Remaining Problem:} Enblend and Enfuse write images
  with an alpha channel;\genidx{alpha channel} \genidx{channel!alpha}
  for more information on alpha channels see
  Chapter~\fullref{sec:understanding-masks}.  Furthermore, the final
  image rarely is rectangular.

\item[Postprocess]\itemend Postprocess the combined image with your
  favorite tool.  Often the user will want to crop the image and
  simultaneously throw away the alpha channel.
