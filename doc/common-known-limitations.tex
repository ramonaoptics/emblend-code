Both applications, \application{Enblend} and \application{Enfuse} have
limitations.  Some of them are inherent to the programs proper others
are ``imported'' by using libraries as for example
\uref{\hciiwrvigra}{\acronym{VIGRA}}.  Here are some of the known
limitations.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \acronym{BigTIFF}\genidx{BigTIFF@\acronym{BigTIFF}} image
    format is not supported.

  \item Total size of \emph{any} (even intermediate) image is limit of
    to $2^{31}$~pixels, this is two giga-pixels.
\end{itemize}
