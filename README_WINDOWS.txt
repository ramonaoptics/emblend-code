Using Enfuse and enblend:
=========================

To blend a set of images, simply use drag and drop the images, or a folder
with images inside onto one of these droplets:

enfuse_droplet.bat
  Exposure blend a set of stacked images

enfuse_droplet_360.bat
  Exposure blend a set of stacked 360° panoramas.


Read enfuse_droplet_readme.txt for more detailed information on the droplets.


Enfuse:
-------
Enfuse is a program for fully automatic exposure blending. It can fully
automatically composit a set of differently exposed image (for example,
captued with the exposure backet function of most cameras) into a pleasant
image that contains both the shadow and highlight details.

In contrast to most HDR programs, this works fully automatically
and produces images with a natural look.

Enblend:
--------

Enblend is a tool for compositing panoramic images. Given a set of
images that overlap in some irregular way, Enblend overlays them
in such a way that the seam between the images is invisible, or
at least very difficult to see. Enblend does not line up the
images for you. Use a tool like Hugin (http://hugin.sf.net) to do that.
