* Programs

This packages contains the programs Enblend and Enfuse.  The source
code and further information about Enblend are available at:
        http://enblend.sf.net

** Enblend

Enblend is a tool for compositing images using a Burt&Adelson
multiresolution spline.  This technique tries to make the seams
between the input images invisible.  The basic idea is that image
features should be blended across a transition zone proportional in
size to the spatial frequency of the features.  For example, objects
like trees and windowpanes have rapid changes in color.  By blending
these features in a narrow zone, you will not be able to see the seam
because the eye already expects to see color changes at the edge of
these features.  Clouds and sky are the opposite.  These features have
to be blended across a wide transition zone because any sudden change
in color will be immediately noticeable.

Enblend expects each input file to have an alpha channel.  The alpha
channel should indicate the region of the file that has valid image
data.  Enblend compares the alpha regions in the input files to find
the areas where images overlap.  Alpha channels can be used to
indicate to Enblend that certain portions of an input image should not
contribute to the final image.

Enblend does not align images for you.  Use a tool like Hugin or
PanoTools to do this.  The files produced by these programs are
exactly what Enblend is designed to work with.

** Enfuse

Enfuse is a tool for automatic exposure blending, contrast blending
and much more.  It can be used to fuse an exposure bracketed step
automatically into a nicely looking image.  See
        doc/enfuse.info
and on Windows also
        contrib/enfuse_droplet/enfuse_droplet_readme.txt
for more information.


* Installation

Also see INSTALL for further information.

** Tarball

        ./configure YOUR-OPTIONS-IF-ANY-GO-HERE
        make
        make install


** Mercurial Repository

        make --makefile=Makefile.scm
        ./configure YOUR-OPTIONS-IF-ANY-GO-HERE
        make
        make install


* Specific Configuration Options

Among the usual configuration options of the GNU autoconf system, the
configure(1) script offers the following options to tailor Enblend and
Enfuse.  Remember that configure(1) creates a file called "config.h"
that can serve for fine-tuning the configuration.


** --enable-gpu-support=CHECK/yes/no

Enable code in Enblend to use the GPU for optimizing the seam line
between two images if all necessary OpenGL libraries are found.
Enfuse does not benefit of this code.  OpenMP (see below) and GPU work
together.

Note that enabling GPU support does not mean Enblend will actually use
the GPU.  Besides passing option "--gpu" to Enblend the hardware as
well as the X11 drivers have to fulfill certain requirements.


** --enable-openmp=yes/NO

Parallelize parts of Enblend and Enfuse with OpenMP.  See
        http://www.openmp.org/

Note that OpenMP support and the image cache must not be activated
both.  The default is to configure with image cache and without
OpenMP.

If OpenMP support has been enabled, the utilization of special
features of the actual, underlying OpenMP implementation can be
controlled as usual with the environment variables OMP_NUM_THREADS,
OMP_NESTED and OMP_DYNAMIC.  See the OpenMP specification for details
on the usage of these variables.


** --enable-split-doc=YES/no

Split the documentation files in INFO or HTML format into small
pieces.  The default is "yes", split documentation.


** --enable-debug=yes/NO

Compile without optimizations and enable all debug-checking code.  The
default is "no", build an optimized version without debugging symbols.


** --enable-image-cache=YES/no

Activate the image-cache feature, which allows for processing of large
images.  The image cache handles swapping parts of the images to disk.
The default is "yes", enable the image cache.

The image cache is recommended on systems where memory is scarce, but
the images to blend or fuse are large.

The image-cache feature and OpenMP support must not be activated
together.


** --with-dmalloc=yes/NO

Compile with the debug-malloc library.  The library is available at
http://www.dmalloc.com/.


** --with-boost-filesystem=CHECK/yes/no/<LIBRARY>

Use Boost "filesystem" library to get platform-independent path
generation.  The default is to check for usability.  "No" forces the
use of the internal path generation library.  Supply a LIBRARY name if
you want to override the default candidates "boost_filesystem-mt" for
multi-threaded compilation and "boost_filesystem" for single-thread
builds.


** --with-openexr=CHECK/yes/no

Build with support for reading and writing OpenEXR images.  See
http://www.openexr.com/ for the required libraries.


** --with-ttf-path=<PATH>

Set PATH to TrueType fonts.  This is only required for building the
documentation.


* Extra Make(1) Variables

You can override Makefile variables the usual way.  In addition the
build process supplies several variables, all starting with "EXTRA",
that add their value to the "usual suspects".  These are

        CPPFLAGS  --  EXTRACPPFLAGS
        CFLAGS    --  EXTRACFLAGS
        CXXFLAGS  --  EXTRACXXFLAGS
        LDFLAGS   --  EXTRALDFLAGS

For example, to quickly add an additional define, use
        make EXTRACPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG_8BIT_ONLY
To compile for coverage analysis, say
        make EXTRACXXFLAGS="-O0 --coverage" EXTRALDFLAGS="--coverage"
analogously for profiling analysis
        make EXTRACXXFLAGS=-pg EXTRALDFLAGS=-pg


* Documentation

The distribution includes some basic documentation in
        doc/enblend.info
        doc/enfuse.info
and the manual pages in
        src/enblend.1
        src/enfuse.1

After the configuration you can build documentation in PostScript,
PDF, and HTML format.
        make ps
        make pdf
        make html

Note that some additional packages are required to build these
formats:
        makeinfo       - GNU documentation generator.
        gnuplot        - Render plots (.gp) in .txt, .png, .eps, and
                         .pdf. Check out http://www.gnuplot.info/.
        freefonts      - Fonts for Gnuplot's .png format
        ghostscript    - Convert .eps to .pdf
        tetex          - Typeset the .texi documents in .ps or .pdf
        texi2html      - Convert .texi to .html.  Find more information
                         at http://www.nongnu.org/texi2html/.
        transfig       - Render XFig drawings in .png, .eps, and .pdf.
                         Check out http://www.xfig.org/ for Transfig.


* Operating System Specific Instructions and Hints

** GNU/Linux

*** High-Performance Binaries

To configure and compile high-performance versions of Enblend and
Enfuse configure single CPU systems with
        --disable-image-cache
SMP boxes with
        --disable-image-cache --enable-openmp
and pass
         EXTRACXXFLAGS="-march=native -O2"
to make(1).  The resulting binaries are pretty fast, although other
configuration options or compiler flags might improve their
performance even more.

*** Xmi and Xi

To avoid direct linkage to the two X11 libraries Xmi and Xi add
"--without-x" to the parameters of configure(1).


** MacOS

** Win
