Enblend is a tool for compositing images using a Burt & Adelson multiresolution
spline. This technique tries to make the seams between the input images
invisible. The basic idea is that image features should be blended across a
transition zone proportional in size to the spatial frequency of the features.
For example, objects like trees and windowpanes have rapid changes in color.
By blending these features in a narrow zone, you will not be able to see the
seam because the eye already expects to see color changes at the edge of these
features. Clouds and sky are the opposite. These features have to be blended
across a wide transition zone because any sudden change in color will be
immediately noticeable.

Enblend expects each input TIFF to have an alpha channel. The alpha channel
should indicate the region of the file that has valid image data. Enblend
compares the alpha regions in the input files to find the areas where images
overlap. Alpha channels can be used to indicate to Enblend that certain
portions of an input image should not contribute to the final image.

Enblend does not align images for you. Use a tool like Hugin or PanoTools
to do this. The TIFFs produced by these programs are exactly what Enblend is
designed to work with.

                    ENFUSE

Enfuse is a tool for automatic exposure and contrast blending. It can be used
to fuse an exposure bracketed step automatically into a nicely looking image.
See enfuse.html (and on windows enfuse_droplet_readme.txt) for more
information.
