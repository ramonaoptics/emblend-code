.SH NAME
enblend \- manual page for enblend 3.2-staging
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B enblend
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI-o OUTPUT INPUT\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Blend INPUT images into a single OUTPUT image.
.SS "Common options:"
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
pre\-assemble non\-overlapping images
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-l\fR LEVELS
number of blending LEVELS to use (1 to 29)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
write output to FILENAME
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
verbosely report progress; repeat to
increase verbosity
.TP
\fB\-w\fR
blend across \fB\-180\fR/+180 degrees boundary
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
checkpoint partial results
.TP
\fB\-z\fR
use LZW compression (TIFF only); kept for
backward compatability with older scripts
.TP
\fB\-\-compression\fR=\fICOMP\fR
set compression of output image to COMP,
where COMP is:
.IP
NONE, PACKBITS, LZW, DEFLATE for TIFF files and
0 to 100 for JPEG files
.SS "Extended options:"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR BLOCKSIZE
image cache BLOCKSIZE in kilobytes; default: 2048KB
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
use CIECAM02 to blend colors
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-depth\fR=\fIDEPTH\fR
Set the number of bits per channel of the output image.
DEPTH is 8, 16, 32, r32, or r64.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
associated\-alpha hack for Gimp (before version 2)
and Cinepaint
.TP
\fB\-\-gpu\fR
use graphics card to accelerate some computations
.TP
\fB\-f\fR WIDTHxHEIGHT[+xXOFFSET+yYOFFSET]
manually set the size and position of the output
image; useful for cropped and shifted input
TIFF images, such as those produced by Nona
.TP
\fB\-m\fR CACHESIZE
set image CACHESIZE in megabytes; default: 1024MB
.TP
\fB\-\-visualize\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
save results of optimizer in FILENAME
.SS "Mask generation options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-coarse\-mask\fR
use an approximation to speedup mask generation;
this is the default
.TP
\fB\-\-fine\-mask\fR
enable detailed mask generation (slow!); use if
overlap regions are very narrow
.TP
\fB\-\-optimize\fR
turn on mask optimization; this is the default
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-optimize\fR
turn off mask optimization
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-mask\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
save the generated mask to FILENAME
.TP
\fB\-\-load\-mask\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
use the mask in FILENAME instead of generating one
