.SH NAME
enblend \- manual page for enblend 4.2-12b596d6fb50
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B enblend
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fI--output=IMAGE\fR] \fIINPUT\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Blend INPUT images into a single IMAGE.
.PP
INPUT... are image filenames or response filenames.  Response
filenames start with an "@" character.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Common options:"
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-levels\fR=\fILEVELS\fR
limit number of blending LEVELS to use (1 to 29);
negative number of LEVELS decreases maximum;
"auto" restores the default automatic maximization
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILE\fR
write output to FILE; default: "a.tif"
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR[=\fILEVEL\fR]
verbosely report progress; repeat to
increase verbosity or directly set to LEVEL
.TP
\fB\-\-compression\fR=\fICOMPRESSION\fR
set compression of output image to COMPRESSION,
where COMPRESSION is:
"deflate", "jpeg", "lzw", "none", "packbits", for TIFF files and
0 to 100, or "jpeg", "jpeg\-arith" for JPEG files,
where "jpeg" and "jpeg\-arith" accept a compression level
.TP
\fB\-\-gpu\fR
employ GPU in addition to CPU for selected computations; negate
with "\-\-no\-gpu"
.SS "Advanced options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-blend\-colorspace\fR=\fICOLORSPACE\fR
force COLORSPACE for blending operations; Enfuse uses
"CIECAM" for images with ICC\-profile and "IDENTITY" for
those without and also for all floating\-point images;
other available blend color spaces are "CIELAB" and
"CIELUV"
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-ciecam\fR
use CIECAM02 to blend colors; disable with "\-\-no\-ciecam";
note that this option will be withdrawn in favor of
"\-\-blend\-colorspace"
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-depth\fR=\fIDEPTH\fR
set the number of bits per channel of the output
image, where DEPTH is "8", "16", "32", "r32", or "r64"
.TP
\fB\-f\fR WIDTHxHEIGHT[+xXOFFSET+yYOFFSET]
manually set the size and position of the output
image; useful for cropped and shifted input
TIFF images, such as those produced by Nona
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
associated\-alpha hack for Gimp (before version 2)
and Cinepaint
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-wrap\fR[=\fIMODE\fR]
wrap around image boundary, where MODE is "none",
"horizontal", "vertical", or "both"; default: none;
without argument the option selects horizontal wrapping
.SS "Mask generation options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-coarse\-mask\fR[=\fIFACTOR\fR] shrink overlap regions by FACTOR to speedup mask
generation; this is the default; if omitted FACTOR
defaults to 8
.TP
\fB\-\-fine\-mask\fR
generate mask at full image resolution; use e.g.
if overlap regions are very narrow
.TP
\fB\-\-optimize\fR
turn on mask optimization; this is the default;
disable with "\-\-no\-optimize"
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-masks\fR[=\fITEMPLATE\fR]
save generated masks in TEMPLATE; default: "mask\-%n.tif";
conversion chars: "%i": mask index, "%n": mask number,
"%p": full path, "%d": dirname, "%b": basename,
"%f": filename, "%e": extension; lowercase characters
refer to input images uppercase to the output image
.TP
\fB\-\-load\-masks\fR[=\fITEMPLATE\fR]
use existing masks in TEMPLATE instead of generating
them; same template characters as "\-\-save\-masks";
default: "mask\-%n.tif"
.TP
\fB\-\-visualize\fR[=\fITEMPLATE\fR] save results of optimizer in TEMPLATE; same template
characters as "\-\-save\-masks"; default: "vis\-%n.tif"
.SS "Expert options:"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-pre\-assemble\fR
pre\-assemble non\-overlapping images; negate with "\-\-no\-pre\-assemble"
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
checkpoint partial results
.TP
\fB\-\-fallback\-profile\fR=\fIPROFILE\-FILE\fR
use the ICC profile from PROFILE\-FILE instead of sRGB
.TP
\fB\-\-layer\-selector\fR=\fIALGORITHM\fR
set the layer selector ALGORITHM;
default: "all\-layers"; available algorithms are:
"all\-layers": select all layers in all images;
"first\-layer": select only first layer in each multi\-layer image;
"largest\-layer": select largest layer in each multi\-layer image;
"no\-layer": do not select any layer from any image;
.TP
\fB\-\-prefer\-gpu\fR=\fIDEVICE\fR
select DEVICE on autodetected platform as GPU
.TP
\fB\-\-prefer\-gpu\fR=\fIPLATFORM\fR:DEVICE
select DEVICE on PLATFORM as GPU
.TP
\fB\-\-parameter\fR=\fIKEY1[=VALUE1][\fR:KEY2[=VALUE2][:...]]
set one or more KEY\-VALUE pairs
.SS "Expert mask generation options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-primary\-seam\-generator\fR=\fIALGORITHM\fR
use main seam finder ALGORITHM, where ALGORITHM is
"nearest\-feature\-transform" or "graph\-cut";
default: "graph\-cut"
.TP
\fB\-\-image\-difference\fR=\fIALGORITHM[\fR:LUMINANCE\-WEIGHT[:CHROMINANCE\-WEIGHT]]
use ALGORITHM for calculation of the difference image,
where ALGORITHM is "max\-hue\-luminance" or "delta\-e";
LUMINANCE\-WEIGHT and CHROMINANCE\-WEIGHT define the
weights of lightness and color; default: delta\-e:1:1
.TP
\fB\-\-optimizer\-weights\fR=\fIDISTANCE\-WEIGHT[\fR:MISMATCH\-WEIGHT]
set the optimizer's weigths for distance and mismatch;
default: 8:1
.TP
\fB\-\-mask\-vectorize\fR=\fILENGTH\fR
set LENGTH of single seam segment; append "%" for
relative value; defaults: 4 for coarse masks and
20 for fine masks
.TP
\fB\-\-anneal\fR=\fITAU[\fR:DELTAE\-MAX[:DELTAE\-MIN[:K\-MAX]]]
set annealing parameters of optimizer strategy 1;
defaults: 0.75:7000:5:32
.TP
\fB\-\-dijkstra\fR=\fIRADIUS\fR
set search RADIUS of optimizer strategy 2; default:
25 pixels
.SS "Information options:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-globbing\-algorithms\fR
show all globbing algorithms
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-gpu\-info\fR
list all available GPUs according to their platform and device;
inform on current preferences
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-image\-formats\fR
show all recognized image formats and their filename
extensions
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-signature\fR
show who compiled the binary when and on which machine
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-software\-components\fR
show the software components with which Enblend was compiled
.PP
Enblend accepts arguments to any option in uppercase as
well as in lowercase letters.
