.SH SYNOPSIS
.B enfuse
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI-o OUTPUT INPUT\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fuse INPUT images into a single OUTPUT image.
.SS "Common options:"
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-l\fR LEVELS
number of blending levels to use (1 to 29)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIFILENAME\fR
write output to FILENAME
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
verbosely report progress; repeat to
increase verbosity
.TP
\fB\-w\fR
blend across \fB\-180\fR/+180 degrees boundary
.TP
\fB\-\-compression\fR=\fICOMP\fR
set compression of output image to COMP,
where COMP is:
.IP
NONE, PACKBITS, LZW, DEFLATE for TIFF files and
0 to 100 for JPEG files
.TP
\fB\-z\fR
use LZW compression (TIFF only); kept for
backward compatability with older scripts
.SS "Extended options:"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR BLOCKSIZE
image cache BLOCKSIZE in kilobytes; default: 2048KB
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
use CIECAM02 to blend colors
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-depth\fR=\fIDEPTH\fR
Set the number of bits per channel of the output image.
DEPTH is 8, 16, 32, r32, or r64.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
associated\-alpha hack for Gimp (before version 2)
and Cinepaint
.TP
\fB\-f\fR WIDTHxHEIGHT[+xXOFFSET+yYOFFSET]
manually set the size and position of the output
image; useful for cropped and shifted input
TIFF images, such as those produced by Nona
.TP
\fB\-m\fR CACHESIZE
set image CACHESIZE in megabytes; default: 1024MB
.SS "Fusion options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-wExposure\fR=\fIWEIGHT\fR
weight given to well\-exposed pixels
(0 <= WEIGHT <= 1); default: 1
.TP
\fB\-\-wSaturation\fR=\fIWEIGHT\fR
weight given to highly\-saturated pixels
(0 <= WEIGHT <= 1); default: 0.2
.TP
\fB\-\-wContrast\fR=\fIWEIGHT\fR
weight given to high\-contrast pixels
(0 <= WEIGHT <= 1); default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-wEntropy\fR=\fIWEIGHT\fR
weight given to high entropy regions
(0 <= WEIGHT <= 1); default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-wMu\fR=\fIMEAN\fR
center aka MEAN of gaussian weighting
function (0 <= MEAN <= 1); default: 0.5
.TP
\fB\-\-wSigma\fR=\fISIGMA\fR
standard deviation of gaussian weighting
function (SIGMA > 0); default: 0.2
.TP
\fB\-\-SoftMask\fR
average over all masks; this is the default
.TP
\fB\-\-HardMask\fR
force hard blend masks and no averaging on finest
scale; this is especially useful for focus
stacks with thin and high contrast features,
but leads to increased noise
.SS "Expert options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-ContrastWindowSize\fR=\fISIZE\fR
set window SIZE for local\-contrast analysis
(SIZE >= 3); default: 5
.TP
\fB\-\-GrayProjector\fR=\fIOPERATOR\fR
apply grayscale projection OPERATOR, where
OPERATOR is one of "average", "l\-star",
"lightness", "value", "luminance", or
"channel\-mixer:RED\-WEIGHT:GREEN\-WEIGHT:BLUE\-WEIGHT";
default: "average"
.TP
\fB\-\-EdgeScale\fR=\fIEDGESCALE[\fR:LCESCALE[:LCEFACTOR]]
set scale on which to look for edges; positive
LCESCALE switches on local contrast enhancement
by LCEFACTOR (EDGESCALE, LCESCALE, LCEFACTOR >= 0);
append "%" to LCESCALE for values relative to
EDGESCALE; append "%" to LCEFACTOR for relative
value; defaults: 0:0:0
.TP
\fB\-\-MinCurvature\fR=\fICURVATURE\fR
minimum CURVATURE for an edge to qualify; append
"%" for relative values; default: 0
.TP
\fB\-\-EntropyWindowSize\fR=\fISIZE\fR
set window SIZE for local entropy analysis
(SIZE >= 3); default: 3
.TP
\fB\-\-EntropyCutoff\fR=\fILOWERCUTOFF[\fR:UPPERCUTOFF]
LOWERCUTOFF is the value below of which pixels are
treated as black and UPPERCUTOFF is the value above
of which pixels are treated as white in the entropy
weighting; append "%" signs for relative values;
default: 0%:100%
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
output mask images for debugging
